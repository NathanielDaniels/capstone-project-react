# Cart Icon Challenge

Change the cart icon in the header to display the full cart icon if there are any items in the cart

Full class name to use WHEN ITEMS IN CART:
"ri-shopping-cart-fill ri-fw ri-2x"

Full class name to use WHEN CART IS EMPTY:
"ri-shopping-cart-line ri-fw ri-2x"

//===================================================================

# Change Cart Icon Challenge

Change the plus icon to a full shopping cart icon when an image is already in the cart. This should display whether the image is being hovered or not (like the favorite icon).

Icon to use when item already in cart:
<i className="ri-shopping-cart-fill cart"></i>

# CartItem Context Challenge

Setup context to manage items in an array called `cartItems`. This will be an array of image objects.

1. Add the `cartItems` state to context. (Array)
2. Add function to add an image to the cart. (Takes the full image object as parameter)
3. Make it so clicking the plus icon on the image adds the item to the cart. (Console.log the cart items array to see that it's working)

//===================================================================

# PropTypes Challenge

Add propTypes to the Image component

1. className should be a string
2. img should be an object, specifically an object with `id`, `url`, and `isFavorite` properties
   a. Hint: Specifying the properties of an object is called and object's "shape"

# Display Favorites Challenge

Make the image display the filled heart icon when it's already favorited

Logic to follow:

- If the image is favorited, display the filled heart icon always
- Otherwise, if the image being hovered on, display the heart outline instead
- If it isn't favorited OR hovered on, don't display anything

Remember to make it so clicking the filled heart icon ALSO runs the toggleFavorite function!

Filled heart icon:
<i className="ri-heart-fill favorite"></i>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
